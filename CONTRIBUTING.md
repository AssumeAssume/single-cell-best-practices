# Contributing

We highly welcome community contributions and encourage contributions.
However, the complex single-cell environments and the modern building of a book with integrated code entails a complex environment setup.

## Book architecture

The book is based on the awesome [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) which we use to build the book.
Architecture wise it is heavily inspired by the [scikit-learn-mooc](https://github.com/INRIA/scikit-learn-mooc) with the aid of [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext).
We highly recommend working through the short [jupyter-book tutorial](https://jupyterbook.org/start/your-first-book.html) which introduces the key concepts required to build a jupyter-book.
Since our big book with many executable notebooks would quickly result in very messy histories and diffs we make use of [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext). Besides the [jupytext documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest), [this blog](https://medium.com/capital-fund-management/automated-reports-with-jupyter-notebooks-using-jupytext-and-papermill-619e60c37330) on the benefits of such an approach is recommended reading.

Here is an overview of all relevant (some are omitted for clarity) files which will be explained below:

The main difference from a classical jupyter-book setup is that we don't work on and integrate Jupyter Notebooks directly, but we convert scripts into Jupyter Notebooks. These scripts can be found in the [notebook_scripts folder](single-cell-best-practices/tree/master/notebook_scripts). When contributing only these scripts should be edited. Do not edit the notebooks in the [notebooks folder](single-cell-best-practices/tree/master/notebooks) since they are autogenerated!

The following sections will introduce how to setup the environment, how to build the notebooks and how to build the complete book.

## Environment setup

We provide a Docker container with  TODO LH DO THIS

## Executing the notebooks

To update all the notebooks:

```bash
$ make
```

If you want to generate a single notebook, you can do something similar to this:
```bash
$ make notebooks/notebook.ipynb
```

## Building the book

From inside the Docker container run:

```bash
$ make jupyter-book
```

Note that all cached notebooks will not be rebuild. To force the rebuilding of all notebooks run:

```bash
$ make jupyter-book-full-clean
```

which will remove the cache files.

To view the built book with e.g. firefox:

```bash
$ firefox jupyter-book/_build/html/index.html
```

## Contributing new quizzes and solutions




## Recommended workflow : Visual Studio Code

- Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install the [Jupyter Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).
  This will allow you to run Python files in a cell by cell fashion
- notebooks are generated through the Jupytext command-line interface (see
  [below](#updating-the-notebooks))

It may well be that alternative editors (e.g. PyCharm) allow you to have a
similar workflow, the only feature you need is to be able to run a `.py` file
in a cell-by-cell fashion with `# %%` cell markers.

## Alternative workflow within Jupyter

- you can configure Jupyter to open `.py` files as notebooks (see
  [below](#setting-up-jupytext) for instructions) though Jupytext
- when saving the notebook inside Jupyter it will actually write to the `.py` file

In our experience, this workflow is less convenient (Visual Studio Code is a
nicer developping environment) and also it tends to add some not very important
(and different on everyone's machine) metadata changes in the `.py` file, for
example about jupytext version, Jupyter kernel, Python version, etc ...

### Setting up jupytext

When jupytext is properly connected to jupyter, the python files can be
opened in jupyter and are directly displayed as notebooks

**With jupyter notebook**

Once jupytext is installed, run the following command:

```
jupyter serverextension enable jupytext
```

**With jupyter lab**

To make it work with "jupyter lab" (instead of
"jupyter notebook"), you have to install nodejs (`conda install nodejs`
works if you use conda). Then in jupyter lab you have to right click
"Open with -> notebook" to open the python scripts with the notebook
interface.

## Useful `make` commands to generate derived files

### Generating exercises from the solutions

```
make exercises
```

The convention in solution files:
- using `# solution` comment inside a cell will remove all the content afterwards
  (including the `# solution` line) and replace it with `# Write your code here`.
- using `tags=["solution"]` on the same line as the cell marker removes the
  whole cell, for example:
  + for Python cells: `# %% tags=["solution"]`
  + for Markdown cells: `# %% [markdown] tags=["solution"]`

### Generating quizzes questions from the gitlab quizzes

To update the github quizzes (quizzes without solutions) from the gitlab
quizzes (quizzes with solutions).

```
make quizzes
```

## JupyterBook

JupyterBook is the tool we use to generate our .github.io website from our
`.py` and `.md` files (note than `.ipynb` files are not used in our JupyterBook
setup).

```
make jupyter-book
```

Generated files are in `jupyter-book/_build/html`. To open the generated JupyterBook with Firefox:
```
firefox jupyter-book/_build/html/index.html
```

Note: for slides (and maybe a few other things), you need to start a local
webserver otherwise there are issues with the way we do iframes etc ...

```sh
cd jupyter-book/_build/html/index.html && python -m http.server
```

and then open a browser at `localhost:8000`.

### Get wrap-up quiz solutions code

You can convert the quiz `.md` file to `.py` with valid Python code. This is
particularly useful to check quiz solutions or to try to debug user questions
on the forum.

```
jupytext --to py jupyter-book/linear_models/linear_models_wrap_up_quiz.md
```

This creates `jupyter-book/linear_models/linear_models_wrap_up_quiz.py` with
executable code.

Note: for this to work nicely with Jupytext you need to use `python` and not
`py` in the block codes i.e.:
``````
```python
```
``````

and not:
``````
```py
```
``````

## Environment set up

A docker container with a working sc-tutorial environment is now available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/leanderd/single-cell-analysis) thanks to [Leander Dony](https://github.com/le-ander). If you would like to set up the environment via conda or manually outside of the docker container, please follow the instructions below.

## Downloading the data

As mentioned above the data for the case study comes from GSE92332. To run the case study as shown, you must download this data and place it in the correct folder. Unpacking the data requires `tar` and `gunzip`, which should already be available on most systems. If you are cloning the github repository and have the case study script in a `latest_notebook/` folder, then from the location where you store the case study ipynb file, this can be done via the following commands:

```
cd ../  #To get to the main github repo folder
mkdir -p data/Haber-et-al_mouse-intestinal-epithelium/
cd data/Haber-et-al_mouse-intestinal-epithelium/
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE92nnn/GSE92332/suppl/GSE92332_RAW.tar
mkdir GSE92332_RAW
tar -C GSE92332_RAW -xvf GSE92332_RAW.tar
gunzip GSE92332_RAW/*_Regional_*
```

The annotated dataset with which we briefly compare the results at the end of the notebook, is available from the same GEO accession ID (GSE92332). It can be obtained using the following command:

```
cd data/Haber-et-al_mouse-intestinal-epithelium/
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE92nnn/GSE92332/suppl/GSE92332_Regional_UMIcounts.txt.gz
gunzip GSE92332_Regional_UMIcounts.txt.gz
```
