	abstract = {Recent years have seen a revolution in single-cell technologies, particularly single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). As the number, size and complexity of scRNA-seq datasets continue to increase, so does the number of computational methods and software tools for extracting meaning from them. Since 2016 the scRNA-tools database has catalogued software tools for analysing scRNA-seq data. With the number of tools in the database passing 1000, we take this opportunity to provide an update on the state of the project and the field. Analysis of five years of analysis tool tracking data clearly shows the evolution of the field, and that the focus of developers has moved from ordering cells on continuous trajectories to integrating multiple samples and making use of reference datasets. We also find evidence that open science practices reward developers with increased recognition and help accelerate the field.Competing Interest StatementF.J.T. reports receiving consulting fees from Cellarity Inc., and ownership interest in Cellarity, Inc. and Dermagnostix.},
