# ðŸ“° Introducing single-cell RNA-seq

This module will introduce you the basic concepts: what is bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq, how are scRNA-seq workflows
designed and what is the general pipeline in computational analysis.
 
 TODO AS DO THIS AS potentially add challenges, experimental methods, experiment platforms.
 
 ## 1. Bulk RNA-seq
 
 ## 2. scRNA-seq
