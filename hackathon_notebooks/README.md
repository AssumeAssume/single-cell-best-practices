# Hackathon Notebooks

Every topic gets one folder.
Please add the environment that you used (preferably a minimal Conda environment) and the notebook(s) that you wrote.
You might also add additional markdown files which will solely be used for explanations inbetween notebooks.
We are also likely to add subchapters per topic like:
1. Primary takeaway
2. Pitfalls to be aware of
3. Practice tasks
4. Task solutions

This is to be discussed, but you can already keep it in mind add those things in their own markdown files.
